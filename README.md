## 📌 Project Overview

CS-NET is a **Transformer**-based deep learning framework for analyzing Counter-Strike 2 match replays (`.dem` demo files). It parses match recordings, converts game states into token sequences, and uses pre-trained Transformer models for multiple real-time predictions.

In short: **given a match replay, the model tells you who will win, who will die, and who is most likely to get the next kill.**

### Prediction Tasks

| Task | Description | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Win Rate Prediction** | Probability of team1 (mapped from CT/T by side) winning the current round | Scalar in [0, 1] |
| **Alive Prediction** | Per-player probability of surviving the next 5 seconds | One probability per player |
| **Next Kill Prediction** | Which player is most likely to get the next kill | Probability distribution over 10+1 classes |
| **Next Death Prediction** | Which player is most likely to die next | Probability distribution over 10+1 classes |
| **Duel Prediction** | 1v1 win probability for any CT-T player pair | 5x5 probability matrix |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

Create a Python environment and install dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n cs-net python=3.10
conda activate cs-net
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Pre-trained Models

Download all pre-trained models and tokenizers to `./cs-net-models/`:

Model weights are also available here: https://huggingface.co/gary2oos/CS-Net-V3

```bash
python -m scripts.download_model
```

### 3. Convert Demo to JSON

Process a Counter-Strike demo file (.dem) into structured JSON format:

`examples/test.dem` is intentionally NOT included in this repository because demo files are too large.
You must download a `.dem` file yourself (for example from HLTV) and replace the input path.

```bash
python -m data.process_demo \
  -path examples/test.dem \
  -interval 0.25 \
  -out examples/test.json
```

### 4. Download Test Data

To reproduce the calibration/evaluation numbers below, download the test shard first:

```bash
python -m scripts.download_data
```

This script downloads `test/shards-00000.tar` from Hugging Face and stores it under `./dataset/test/`.

### 5. Calibrate Temperature Scaling

You can calibrate the model3.0 heads with:

```bash
python -m scripts.train3_t_scaling --dataset_path dataset --device cpu
```

On the current test shard, the calibration results are:

| Task | T | Before Loss | Before ECE | Before Acc | After Loss | After ECE | After Acc |
|------|---|-------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Alive | 1.193158 | 0.431486 | 0.028640 | 0.774641 | 0.429344 | 0.021371 | 0.774641 |
| Duel | 1.146975 | 0.633122 | 0.017835 | 0.632217 | 0.632133 | 0.014517 | 0.632217 |
| Next Death | 1.493995 | 1.785793 | 0.077382 | 0.342485 | 1.741089 | 0.012107 | 0.342485 |
| Next Kill | 1.602551 | 1.801647 | 0.102502 | 0.339024 | 1.736153 | 0.012922 | 0.339024 |
| Win Rate | 1.061342 | 0.467820 | 0.029351 | 0.754566 | 0.467459 | 0.029516 | 0.754566 |

## 🌐 Web App Usage

CS-NET now includes an interactive web app for demo analysis and LLM-based post-game summary.

> **Attribution Notice**
> The built-in 2D viewer is a modified integration of
> [`sparkoo/csgo-2d-demo-viewer`](https://github.com/sparkoo/csgo-2d-demo-viewer).
> We use the upstream project under the MIT License and adapt it for CS-NET's
> Flask routes and model-prediction overlays.

### 1. Start the web app

```bash
python -m demo_analysis.web_app
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

### 2. Analyze a demo in UI

1. Upload a .dem file.
2. Select the **model root directory** (normally `cs-net-models/`). The web app
   loads all five prediction heads (`alive`, `nxt_kill`, `nxt_death`,
   `win_rate`, `duel`) from their subdirectories in one go.
3. Select device (cpu / cuda).
4. Click Start Analysis.

### 3. Generate LLM summary

1. Fill API Key, model name, and Base URL (OpenAI-compatible).
2. Choose app language (Chinese / English).
3. Click Generate AI Review.

## ✨ Web App Features

- Bilingual UI and bilingual LLM output (Chinese / English).
- Round-by-round win-rate curve with kill markers.
- Hover-to-inspect player contribution at each timeline point.
- **Live 2D radar** that syncs with the win-rate curve — player positions,
  team colour, alive/dead state, and "recently flashed" flag are drawn on the
  real minimap overview for every tick the cursor touches.
- **Per-tick metric panels** driven by all four prediction heads:
  5-second survival probability, next-kill distribution, next-death
  distribution, and the full 5×5 CT-vs-T duel matrix.
- **Advanced metrics table** aggregated across the whole match: per-player
  average kill/death/survival probability, hard-duel win rate (fights the
  model thought they would lose), easy-duel win rate (fights they were
  favoured in), highlight rate, plus a |swing|-sorted ranking of the most
  impactful kills.
- **One-click 2D replay viewer** — launches a bundled build of
  [`sparkoo/csgo-2d-demo-viewer`](https://github.com/sparkoo/csgo-2d-demo-viewer)
  in a new tab with the same demo, adding smoke/flash/grenade trajectories
  and an in-page timeline overlaid with CS-NET's predictions.
- Current round final contribution table + full match average contribution table.
- MVP and SVP badges.
- LLM summary supports streaming output and Markdown rendering.
- Auto-save user settings in browser local storage:
  API Key, model name, base URL, temperature, device, model path, batch size, language.
- Team-side context for LLM:
  per-round attack/defense roles, first-half/second-half side assignment and half scores.

## 🎯 Impact Engine

The Impact Engine provides advanced player impact analysis based on CS-NET's prediction outputs. It evaluates each player's real influence in each round, distinguishing between kills, deaths, trades, and objective plays.

### Key Features

- **RWI (Round Win Impact)**: Measures how each action affected team win probability
- **Death Risk Assessment**: Distinguishes self-created risk from forced risk deaths
- **Rule-Based Labeling**: Identifies opening kills, trades, clutch plays, and more
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: Combines model-based and rule-based quality scores
- **Chinese Reports**: Generates detailed Chinese-language post-match reports

### Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze a demo and generate reports
python -m demo_analysis.impact_engine.cli \
  --analysis-json output/analysis.json \
  --out report.md \
  --json-out report.json
```

### Output

1. **Markdown Report** (`--out`): Detailed Chinese analysis with:
   - Per-player ratings (0-100)
   - Model Impact Score / Rule Quality Score
   - High impact rounds count
   - Death analysis (bad deaths, self-created risk, forced risk)
   - Hard Duel Wins / Easy Duel Losses
   - Key positive/negative events
   - Improvement suggestions

2. **JSON Output** (`--json-out`): Structured data for further processing

### Scoring Formula

```
Final Score = Model Impact Score × 0.65 + Rule Quality Score × 0.35

Model Impact Score = RWI总和 + Hard Duel Wins × 0.8 - Easy Duel Losses × 0.6
Rule Quality Score = 补枪加分 + 残局加分 - 白给死亡扣分 - 自造风险扣分
```

### Configuration

All weights are in `demo_analysis/impact_engine/config.py`. Adjust to tune scoring sensitivity.
